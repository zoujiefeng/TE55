 * This is a template file. It defines integration functions necessary to complete RTA-BSW.
 * The integrator must complete the templates before deploying software containing functions defined in this file.
 * Once templates have been completed, the integrator should delete the #error line.
 * Note: The integrator is responsible for updates made to this file.
 *
 * To remove the following error define the macro NOT_READY_FOR_TESTING_OR_DEPLOYMENT with a compiler option (e.g. -D NOT_READY_FOR_TESTING_OR_DEPLOYMENT)
 * The removal of the error only allows the user to proceed with the building phase

 *  If the Key sent by the tester is invalid for a particular security level then this API is called with the index of the security table.
 *  This API is an indication to the Application about the invalid key received.\n
 *  More information : Using the API DcmAppl_DcmCompareKey the check for the validity of the key sent from the tester will be performed for the KEY request.
 *  If the key sent from the tester is invalid (DcmAppl_DcmCompareKey returns DCM_E_COMPARE_KEY_FAILED) then the notification is given to application to perform any  operations if required.
 *  If the all the updations from application is completed ,then the function should return E_OK;if something is in progress or some operations  didn't happen properly,
 *  it should return DCM_E_PENDING.The function should be aware about the return value for the previous call because in case of DCM_E_PENDING ,DCM will call the function repeatedly for the same security level until it gets E_OK.\n
 *
 *  Ex: Tester Sends the key request and DcmAppl_DcmCompareKey returns DCM_E_COMPARE_KEY_FAILED.
 *  Notification is given to application that the key is invalid (DcmAppl_DcmSecaInValidKey)
