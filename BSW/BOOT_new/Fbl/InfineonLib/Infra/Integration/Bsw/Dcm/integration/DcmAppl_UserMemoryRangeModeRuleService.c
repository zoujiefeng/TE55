 * The integrator must complete the templates before deploying software containing functions defined in this file.
 * Once templates have been completed, the integrator should delete the #error line.
 * Note: The integrator is responsible for updates made to this file.

 * To remove the following error define the macro NOT_READY_FOR_TESTING_OR_DEPLOYMENT with a compiler option (e.g. -D NOT_READY_FOR_TESTING_OR_DEPLOYMENT)
