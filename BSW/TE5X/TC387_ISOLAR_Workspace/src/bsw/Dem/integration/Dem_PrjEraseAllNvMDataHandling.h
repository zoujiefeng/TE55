/**
 * \brief This method is called in Dem_Init() and decides which part of the NvM should be erased
 *
 * When there is a significant change in the Dem configuration, the entries stored in the event memory might become
 * inconsistent and if events are renumbered, status byte information could be assigned to the wrong events. Therefore
 * it should be erased whenever such a change occurs. This function should run some detection routine and then return
 * which data shall be erased.
 * CAUTION: If this interface Dem_PrjEraseAllNvMDataHandling returns DEM_ERASE_ALL_REQUEST_ALL,then the OBD permanent
 * memory will also be cleared.THIS FEATURE SHOULD ONLY BE USED AFTER FLASHING NEW SOFTWARE OR AT END OF PRODUCTION.
 * NEVER CALL THIS FUNCTION FOR OTHER PURPOSES!!! OTHERWISE OBD CONFORMITY IS VIOLATED.
 *
 * \param HashIdCheckResult Whether the Dem configuration has changed in some significant way.
 *
 *                      DEM_HASH_ID_CHECK_DISABLED - Hash Id check is disabled in configuration
 *                      DEM_HASH_ID_CHECK_NOT_POSSIBLE - Check not possible as Nvm Read for the HashId block failed
 *                      DEM_HASH_ID_NO_CHANGE - No change in HashId
 *                      DEM_HASH_ID_MISMATCH - HashId is changed (Change in Order of Events or Number of Events
 *                                             or Event ID or Event Shortname is detected)
 *
 * \return              Which part of the NvM should be deleted:
 *
 *                      - DEM_ERASE_ALL_REQUEST_NONE: Do not delete anything
 *                      - DEM_ERASE_ALL_REQUEST_ALL: Erase all Dem NvM blocks
