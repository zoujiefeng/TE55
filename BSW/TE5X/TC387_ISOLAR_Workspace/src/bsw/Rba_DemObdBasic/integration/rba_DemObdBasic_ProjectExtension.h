 * Integration hint: Dem doesn't store the variant information in NVRAM. Variant information must be handled outside
 * the Dem and based on that this callback shall be implemented project specific to return TRUE or FALSE.
 * However this callback won't stop storage of permant DTCs. In addition to disabling the MIL, if it is required to
 * stop storage of permant DTCs in the non-OBD variant, then the callback
 * rba_DemObdBasic_IsPermanentDTCStorageDisabled() shall be used.

 * Integration hint: Dem doesn't store the status of "permant DTCs storage being disabled" in NVRam and hence if this
 * blocking is required across power cycles, then it must be handled outside Dem and based on that this callback shall
 * be implemented project specific to return TRUE or FALSE.
