 * @ingroup DCM_TPL

 *  This function indicates that successful reception of a new request to manufacturer application
 *  and it is called right before before the DSD verification (SID, security access,diagnostic session).
 *  Within this function application can examine the permission of the diagnostic service /
 *  environment (e.g. ECU state afterrun).
 *
 * @param[in]           RequestData   : Pointer to the request data buffer.
 * @param[in]           SID           : Value of service identifier
 * @param[in]           RequestLength : Request data length.
 * @param[in]           RequestType   : It says whether the request is FUNCTIONAL/PHYSICAL.
 * @param[in]           DcmRxPduId    : RxPduId on which the request is received.
 * @param[in]           SourceAddress : This variable gives the source address.
 * @param[in]           pMsgContext   : This variable holds the details of the completed received msg.
 * @param[out]          ErrorCode     : Ponter to the variable to update the error code.
 * @retval              E_OK: diagnostic request accepted.\n
 * @retval              DCM_E_REQUEST_NOT_ACCEPTED: application rejects diagnostic request -> DSD will ignore
 *                      diagnostic request, no further processing of request, no response will be send.\n
 * @retval              DCM_E_PENDING : application needs more time to respond whether to accept/reject/proccess this request
 * @retval              E_NOT_OK : application rejected the diagnostic request, and negative response response will be send
