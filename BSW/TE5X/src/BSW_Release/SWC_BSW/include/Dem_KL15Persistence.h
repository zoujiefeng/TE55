 * \brief Increased persistence for diagnosis data in clamp 15 ECUs
 *
 * In clamp 15 ECUs the shutdown phase may not run to completion. But in Dem the data is written to Nvm in the shutdown
 * phase only (except event-related data for event which are marked for immediate storage). This template provides a
 * task which shall be scheduled cyclically and triggers the storage of all blocks that have changed since the last
 * storage if a relevant condition has been detected in the last cycle.
 *
 * For example you could have an event status changed callback that checks if the Pending bit has toggled in the status
 * byte, and if so schedule the storage of the data in the next Dem_KL15PersistenceMain cycle. You can also trigger a
 * storage immediately (for example if a critical situation has been detected or you detect that a power-off is
 * imminent).

/**
 * \brief Cyclic task for the clamp 15 persistence
 *
 * Store all Dem blocks to Nvm if Dem_KL15PersistenceScheduleStorage() has been called at least once since the last
 * cycle.
 *
 * The task should probably be scheduled in long intervals to avoid flash trashing in case of toggling events. This
 * task does not actually store the blocks, but the storage happens in the next Dem_Main cycle. It uses the
 * Dem_TriggerStorageToNvm() interface.
